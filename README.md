This repo is designed to demonstrate knowledge in the creation of an API using Node.js

In order to run this project, fork this repo and clone into a new directory.  You will need to add a .env file to the root directory that contains the database password. (The .env file will be included in an email)

Once cloned, launch with a code editor.  If not already done so, install npm on your local machine.  Then run the command 'npm install' within the root directory of this repo.  

Once the node modules have successfully installed, run the command 'npm start' to launch the server and front-end on 'localhost:3030'

Opening localhost:3030 in a web browser will reveal the front-end application designed to interact with the API.

The front-end was created with the Vue framework and is intended to demonstrate successful creation of the API, in addition to providing a simple and easy to use CRUD operations with the database.   

Please email me if you have any questions.  Thank you.
